# ReverseThrust
Reverse Thrust is a score attack game where you control a spaceship and try to continue ascending. 
The goal is to gain as many points as possible without crashing into the surrounding terrain.
Destructable terrain can be cleared by using your thrusters to reverse thrust.

Gameplay is a balance of trying to climb and spinning your ship around to clear obstacles.

Reverse Thrust is inspired heavily on the game Spout! by Kuni.
